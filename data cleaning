Cleaning data in 10 steps 

Data cleaning in 10 steps:

- [ ] Dataset - YouTube  

Step 1: Adjust the row and column height

To-do: 

Excel - Format > Cell Size > Auto adjust height of row and column 

Shortcut : Alt + H +O + A - Rows, Alt + H +O + I - Columns 

Google Sheets - Select the data > Right Click > Fit to data

Step 2: Find and Replace

To-do:

Excel - Select the column > Find and Replace (Ctrl + H) > Select the (*) - all the data and replace with nothing 

Google Sheets - Select the column > Format the column as Plain Text from number 

Edit > Find and Replace (Ctrl +Shift + H) > Use the expression \(.*?\)


Breaking It Down
* \( → Matches a literal opening parenthesis (. The backslash \ is needed because parentheses are special characters in regex, so we need to escape them.
* .*? → Matches any characters (.) zero or more times (*), but in a lazy (non-greedy) way (?).
    * .* alone is greedy, meaning it would match everything between the first ( and the last ).
    * Adding ? makes it lazy, so it stops at the first closing parenthesis ).
* \) → Matches a literal closing parenthesis ), again using \ to escape it.


Step 3: 

Convert the Upper case to lower case

To-do: Both Excel and sheets 

= lower(cell value) > Copy and paste the cells as values (if you delete the main source, the values remain intact after the formula)

Step 4:

To format the data without spacing or format the data without with upper and lower case inconsistencies, use trim and proper

To-do: Both Excel and sheets 
Proper(cell value) -  helps to have Captial letters after spaces
Trim(cell value) - trims the excess space in the cell 

Copy and paste the cells as values (if you delete the main source, the values remain intact after the formula)

Step 5:

Split text to columns 

To-do:
Select the text/ column > Data > Split the data text to columns > Select the separator (it could be custom or similar like a comma, full stop or a semi-colon)

Step 6:

Check for duplicate values and remove them

To-do: 

Excel: Select the entire table > Go to Data > Remove duplicates

Sheets: Select the entire table > Go to data > Data cleanup > Remove duplicates

Step 7:

Filling the blank cells

To-do:

Excel : Select the table > Home > Find and Select > Special > Blanks > N/A > Ctrl + Enter

Google Sheets: Select the table > create a filter > Click on the filter and select the blank values > NA > replace the values manually 

Step 8:

Setting the forumlas by IFERROR

IFERROR(FORMULA,”NA”)
